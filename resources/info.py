theme_of_hackathon = """The Challenge: Exploring and Building Agentic AI Solutions for a High-Impact Area of Society: Agriculture
Agriculture is a high-impact area of Indian society which is well-suited to continuous innovation and experimentation with data, analytics, and AI/ML. AI-driven solutions in this sector have potential to help farmers and others in this sector help answer questions like:

“When should I irrigate?”
“What seed variety suits this unpredictable weather?”
“Will next week’s temperature drop kill my yield?”
“Can I afford to wait for the market to improve?”
“Where can I get affordable credit, and will any state/central government policy help me with finances?”
In this challenge, the questions above may require a multi-modal agentic solution for real-time answering. And the hypothetical user constraints to consider are many, such as lack of internet access.

Your AI agent could potentially address a lot of local constraints if it could:

Understand local, natural-language queries
Synthesize insights across domains like weather, crop cycles, pest science, soil health, finance
Infer meaning, adapt to context, and explain its answers
Be usable by someone with low digital access but high decision responsibility
You will have to tackle:

Noisy, incomplete, non-standard public datasets
Multilingual, code-switched, colloquial questions
Hallucination risks in LLMs and grounding in facts
Design for reliability, explainability, and trust
Real-world edge cases, where the wrong answer has real costs
From retrieval to reasoning, interface to insight, you will need to bring your best thinking in AI/ML, software, product and design.

The task is to build a human-aligned AI-powered advisor which could be used for all sorts of agri-related queries. These could include input materials, crops, harvest, finance or policy related queries. The solution aims to be highly accessible to multiple demographic regions of India and could be aimed at a farmer, financier, vendor or any node in the agricultural industry.

Important Note: Participants can only use publicly available datasets.

We call for the participants to utilize a myriad of hyperlocal unstructured datasets available through public portals. All participants are individually responsible for complying with the terms and conditions of the datasets you use and abide by them, including citing and sourcing the datasets."""

theme_of_hackathon_2 = """The Challenge: Rohan, a young farmer in rural Karnataka, inspects his tomato crop. A strange pattern of yellow spots has appeared on the leaves of several plants. Is it a fungus? A pest? The wrong kind of fertilizer? The local agricultural office is miles away, and by the time he gets an answer, a significant portion of his crop could be lost. He also faces another challenge: when to sell. The price he gets at the local mandi can vary wildly from day to day. A day's delay could mean the difference between profit and loss. He has a smartphone, but the information he needs—expert pest diagnosis, real-time market prices, and guidance on government subsidies—is scattered, complex, and not available in his native Kannada. He doesn't need more data; he needs an ally, an expert in his pocket who understands his land and his language.
The Objective: Build "Shetkari," an AI-powered personal assistant that acts as a personal agronomist, market analyst, and government scheme navigator for small-scale farmers. This agent should provide actionable intelligence to farmers, enabling them to protect crops, maximize income, and navigate complex agricultural systems. The agent should:
Diagnose Crop Diseases Instantly: Allow a farmer to take a photo of a diseased plant. The agent will use a multimodal LLM to instantly analyze the image, identify the pest or disease, and provide clear, actionable advice on locally available and affordable remedies.
Deliver Real-Time Market Analysis: Enable a farmer to ask in their native language, "What is the price of tomatoes today?" The agent, will fetch real-time data from public market APIs, use a LLM to analyze trends, and provide a simple, actionable summary to guide selling decisions.
Navigate Government Schemes: When a farmer asks about a specific need, like "subsidies for drip irrigation," the agent will use a LLM trained on government agricultural websites to explain relevant schemes in simple terms, list eligibility requirements, and provide direct links to application portals.
Enable Voice-First Interaction: Overcome literacy barriers by allowing farmers to interact entirely through voice. The agent will use Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech to understand queries in local dialects and respond with clear, easy-to-understand voice notes. Using ElevenLabs API for Text-to-Speech and OpenAI API for Speech-to-Text."""
