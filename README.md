## Testing the Application

### Mock Sensor Page (http://localhost:5173/mock-sensor) 

Purpose: Simulate IoT sensor payloads for demos and testing without hardware.

Usage:
- Open the app at `http://localhost:5173/mock-sensor`.
- Create a device
- Click "Generate Random" button and then "Send Button" OR Toggle  Auto-Send Mode to send random data every 15 seconds OR Enter parameters (temperature, humidity, soil metrics, etc.) in fields directly.
- Submit to publish synthetic readings to the app state/flows.
- Use Dashboard and Analytics to verify ingestion, banners, and AI recommendations.

### Testing Memory Features in Assistant

The memory system is **session-based** and **user-specific**. Here's how to test it:

#### **Prerequisites for Memory Testing:**
```bash
# 1. Install mem0 dependency
pip install mem0ai

# 2. Set OpenAI API key (required for mem0)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"

# 3. Test memory integration
python test_memory.py
```

#### **Manual Testing Steps:**

1. **Navigate to Assistant Page** (`http://localhost:5173/assistant`)

2. **Start a Conversation with Farm Context:**
   ```
   User: "I have a 5-acre wheat farm in Punjab"
   Bot: [Responds with farming advice]
   ```

3. **Ask Related Questions to Test Memory:**
   ```
   User: "What's the current weather for my farm?"
   Bot: [Should remember your location and farm details]
   
   User: "Should I irrigate my wheat today?"
   Bot: [Should provide context-aware advice for wheat in Punjab]
   ```

4. **Test Memory Persistence:**
   - Refresh the page (new session)
   - Previous session's memory won't carry over (session-based)
   - Start new conversation to build new memory context

#### **What Gets Remembered:**
‚úÖ **Stored in Memory:**
- Farm location and coordinates
